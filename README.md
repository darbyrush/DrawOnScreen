### Directions ###

1.  This app is meant to be part of an art installation where each participant will install on their
device via a Play Store download.  Currently, the application only works on api level 21.  Update the
application to work on all api levels above 21.

2.  The application will run for a while and then it seems to crash and restart.  Fix the app to
run indefinitely.

3.  The class Checker in bad shape and needs to be refactored.  Please refactor the code until it is
as close to your personal standards of coding as you like.  Make sure that the associated
instrumented tests still pass.

When finished, submit your answers via email to the recruiter in the form of a patch file.  This can
be generated by using the command git format-patch or by using Android Studio's "Create Patch from
Local Changes" function.
